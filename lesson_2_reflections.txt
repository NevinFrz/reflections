1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository a .git folder is created. We need a repository to
maintain and create commits.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Working directory contains all the files whereas the staging area contains only
the files that where added to be commited. Repository contains all the files.
